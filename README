Bug  : 0001
    When a food code field is searched for semicolon delimited text,
    if there are no semicolons present, the search will terminate with
    an error even if the field wasn't empty.

Expected Behaviour:
    When a non-empty food code field is searched for semicolon delimited
    text, if there are no semicolons present, the search should
    terminate succesfully returning a list of length 1.


Impact:
    [Major] This piece of code handles all food_codes parsing, so the same
    flaw will affect processing of "FAT_BAKING_FOOD/FAT_FRYING_FOOD/CERIAL_FOOD"

Resolution:
    This is fixed in release 0.0.2-c and later

Bug  : 0002 
    Failure of food_code string parsing is not logged.
    
Expected Behaviour:
    Failure of food_code string parsing should output an error to the
    log with a human readable reason for failure e.g. "Error: milk food_code field was empty"

Impact:
    [Minor] this makes it harder to track down errors but doesn't
    introduce any additional errors

Resolution:
    This is fixed in release 0.0.2-c and later
